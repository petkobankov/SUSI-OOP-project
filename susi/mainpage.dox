Програмата работи с команди от конзолата. Започва без начални специалности, студенти и курсове. Такива могат да се добавят ръчно или като се отвори файлът **start.susi** с команда **open**. Без да се отвори файл не може да се използва.

Във файлът се съдържа следната информация:
| Специалност  | 
| ------------- |
| ComputerScience  | 
| SoftwareEngineering  | 

| Студент  |  Специалност  | Група | Факултетен номер |
| ----- | ----- |----- | ----- |
| Petko  |  ComputerScience  | 7 | 1 |
| Pavel  |  SoftwareEngineering  | 2 | 2 |
| Ivan  |  ComputerScience  | 7 | 3 |
| Krisi  |  SoftwareEngineering  | 1 | 4 |

| Учебна дисциплина  |  Специалност  | Задължителна | Нужен курс |
| ----- | ----- |----- | ----- |
| Program1  |  ComputerScience  | true | 1 |
| Program2  |  ComputerScience  | true | 2 |
| Program3  |  ComputerScience  | true | 3 |
| Program4  |  ComputerScience  | true | 4 |
| FreeP  |  ComputerScience  | false | 1 |
| ProgramX  |  SoftwareEngineering  | true | 1 |
| Program1  |  SoftwareEngineering  | true | 1 |
